# Go Server

Serve a GeoJSON file as a REST Endpoint. Allows cross domain requests. Just change path to the GeoJSON file. 

To add a new file, create another handler route.


Code taken from [Making a RESTful JSON API in Go](http:////thenewstack.io/make-a-restful-json-api-go/) and modified to read json file and allow cross domain requests.
